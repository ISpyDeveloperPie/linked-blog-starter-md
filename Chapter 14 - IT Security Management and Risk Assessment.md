## IT Security Management Overview
- Formal process of answering the questions:
	- What assets need to be protected
	- How are those assets threatened
	- What can be done to coutne rthose threats
	- Ensures that critical assets are sufficiently protected in a cost-effective manner
	- Security risk assessment is needed for each asset in organization that requires protection
	- Provides that information necessary to decide what management, operation, and technical controls are needed to reduce the risks identified

## IT Security Management
- Process used to acheive and maintain appropriate levels of confidentiality, integrity, availability, accountability, authenticity, and reliability
- IT security management functions include (steps):
	1. Determine the Objectives, security policy, strategies
	2. IT security requirements (derived from policy)
	3. Identifying & analyzing threats to assets
	4. Analyze Risks
	5. Specify appropriate safeguards
	6. Implement Safeguards (cost effective)
	7. Security Aronge(?) program
	8. Reponse
- Categories
	- Risk Analysis options: 1-2
	- Risk Analysis: 3-6
	- Implement: 7-8

## The Plan-Do-Check-Act Process Model
- The stuff from IT Security Management Section
- ## LOOK ON SLIDE TO SEE IMAGE

## Organizational Context and Security Policy
- Maintained and updated regularly
	- Using periodic security reviews
	- Reflect chagnign technical/risk environments
	- Exmain role
		- # LOOK ON SLIDE
	- # LOOK ON SLIDE

## Security Policy
- Needs to address:
	- What is the scope?
	- What is requirements?
	- Who si assigned responsibility?
	- What happens if something happens?
	- How to ensure business security?
	- ## More mentioned on slides

## Management Support
- IT security policy must be supported by senior management
- Need IT security officer
	- To provide consistent overall supervision

## Security Risk Assessment
- Critical component
- Four approaches
	- Baseline
		- "Copy/Paste"
		- Uses Industry best practice
			- Easy, cheap, can be replicated
			- Typically for small organizations
	- Informal
		- Uses analyst
		- Fairly quick and cheap
		- Judges made about vulnerabilities and risks that baselien approach would not address
		- Some risks may be incorrectly assessed
		- Skewed by analyst'reviews, varies over time
	- Detailed Risk Anysis
		- Most ocmprehensive approach
		- Process:
			- Number of stages
			- Identify threats and vulnerabiltiies to assets
			- Identify likelihood of risk occuring and consequences
		- Expensive
	- Combined Approach
		- Cost-Effective
		- Used frequently
		- ## LOOK ON SLIDES
	- Detailed Security Anylsis
		- Usually for government agencies and large businesses

## Establishing the Context
- Establish the context
- Identify assets, treats, vulnerabilities
- Analyze Risks
- Evaluate threats & Risks
	- Have a plan in place
	- IT Security Management slide

## Asset Identification
- Asset = anything that needs to be protected / has importance to an organization
- Look on slides

## Terminology
- Asset: anything that needs to be protected / has importance to an organization
- Threat: A potential for a threat source to exploit a vulnerability in some asset
- Vulnerability: flaw or weakness in an asset's design, implementation, or operation and management that could be exploited by some threat
- Risk: potential for loss computed as the combination of the likelihood that a given threat exploits some vulnerability oa an asset, and the magnitude of harmful consequence that resutls ot the asset's owner
	- Aka: potential of threat exploiting vulnerability
## Threat Identification
- Threat is:
	- Anything that prevents asset from doing
		- CIA
		- Authenticity
		- Reliability
		- Confidentiality
- Threats can be:
	- Natural
	- Man-made
	- Accidental or deliberate
- Evaluation of human threat sources should consider:
	- Motivaiton
	- Capability
	- Resources
	- Probability of attack
	- Deterrence
- Any previous experience of attacks seen by the organization also needs to be considered

## Vulnerability Identification
- Identify exploitable flaws or weaknesses in organization's IT systems or processes
	- Determines applicability and significance of threat to organization
- Need to combination of threat and vulnerability to create a risk to an asset
- Outcome should be list of threats and vulnerabilities and a brief description of how they might occur

## Analyze Risks
- Go over the process, and note down what is the likelihood of "that" threat happening on that paritcucalr asset utilizing that certain vulnerability
- Then, find out what is the impact of the threat when it turns into an attack on the systems
- Aka: likelhood and consequences
- Based on this, you get a risk factor on a particular threat

## Analyze Existing Controls
- Existing contorls used to attempt to minimize threats need to be identified
- Security controls include:
	- Management
	- Operational
	- Technical

## Risks Likelihood
1. Rare
2. Unlikely
3. Possible
4. Likely
5. Almost certain

## Risk Consequences
1. Insignificant
2. Minor
3. Moderate
4. Major
5. Catastrophic
6. Doomsday

## Risk Level
- Extreme
- High
- Medium
- Low

## Risk Register
- Internet router
	- Vulnerability: outside hacker attack
	- Existing controls
	- likelihood
	- Consequence
	- Level of risk
	- Risk priority
- Destruction of Data center
	- Look at internet router for information

## Risk Treatment Alternatives
- Risk acceptance
	- Choosing to accept a risk level greate rthan normal for business reasons
- Risk avoidance
	- Not proceeding with the activity or system that creates this risks
- Risk transfer
	- Sharing responsibility for the risk with a third party
- Reduce consequence
	- Modifying the structure or use of the asset at risk to reduce the impact on the organization should the risk occur
- Reduce likelihood
	- Implement suitable controls to lower chance of vulnerability being exploited
