	- Mitigating weaknesses that were exploited
	- Restoring computing services

## Security Incidents
- Unauthorized access to a system
- Unauthorized modificaiton of information on the system
- Anything affecting CIA and extension CIAARA

## Security Incident Terminology
- Artifact
	- Evidence
		- File that may have or is involved in probing, attacking system, etc
- computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT)
- Constituency
- Incident
- Triage
	- Process of receiving, initial soirting, and prioritinzing of information to facilitate its appropriate handling
- Vulnerability

## Detecting Incidents
- Incidents may be detected by users or administration staff
- Automated tools
	- System integrity verification tools
	- Log analysis tools
	- Network and host intrusion detection systems (IDS)

## Triage Function
