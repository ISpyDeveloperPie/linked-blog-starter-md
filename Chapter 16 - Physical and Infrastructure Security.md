## Physical and Infrastructure Security
- Logical Security
	- Protects data from software and communication threats
- Physical security
	- Prevent Physical Damage
	- Prevent Misuse (Ex: theft, vandalism, etc...)
- Premises security
	- Protects people and property

## Physical Security Overview
- Physical Security Threats
	- Environmental Threats
		- Natural disasters
		- Temperature
			- Thresholds for damage to computing resources
		- Water Damage
		- Chemical, radiological, etc
		- Dust and Infestation
	- Technical Threats
		- Electrical power is essential
			- Power utility problems:
				- Under-voltage: dips/brownouts/outages
				- Over-voltage: surges/faults/ligtening
				- Noise: on power lines
		- Electromagnetic interference (EMI)
			- Two signals interact with each other
				- Ex: when you bring a mic next to a speaker
	- Human-caused Threats
		- Less predictable, hard to deal with
		- Include:
			- Unauthorized physical access
			- Theft
			- Vandalism
			- Misuse of resources
- Physical Security Prevention and Mitigation Measures
	- Environment
		- Fire alarms
		- Manage Water
		- Etc...
	- Technical Threats
		- Uninterruptible power supply (UPS)
		- Generator
		- Dela with EMI a combination of filters and shielding can be used
	- Human-Caused Threats
		- Physical access control
			- Restrict building access
			- Controlled areas patrolled or guarded
			- Security on power switch
			- Etc...

## Recovery from Physical Security Breaches
- Most essential emenet is redundancy
	- Can use batch encrypted remote backup
	- Ideally all important data should be available off-site and updated as often as feasible
	- Provides for recovery from loss of data
- Physical equipment damage recovery
	- May need specialist

## Physical and Logical Security Integration
- Numerous detection and prevention devices
- More effective if there is a central control
- Integrate automated physical and logical security functions

## Degrees of Security and Control for Protected Areas
- Unrestricted
- Controlled
- Limited
- Exclusion
