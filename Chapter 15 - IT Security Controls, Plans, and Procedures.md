- Ex:
	- Step 1: Prioritize risks
	- Step 2: Respond to risks
	- Step 3: Monitor risks

## Risk Acceptance
- Accept risk analyzed from another team and say that you are fine

## Risk Avoidance
- Talk with other teams and come up with certain plan to overcome the risk'

## Risk LOOK ON SLIDES
- Talk with other teams to avoid risk

## Risk LOOK ON SLIDES
- LOOK ON SLIDES

## Security control
- Control is defined as:
	- Action, device, procedure, or other measure that reduces risks by eliminating or preventing a security violation, by minimizing the harm it can cause, or by discovering and reporting it to enable corrective action

## Control Classifications
- Management Controls
	- **high level**
	- Strategies, planning, policies
- Operational controls
	- More hands on
	- Training session for employees to manage data, swiping a keycard
	- Not about software, its about the individual
- Technical control
	- Hardware and software solutions
	- Firewalls, softwalls, IDS

## Control Classes
- Each of control class may include the followign:
	- Supportive controls
		- Additional trust / Authentication
	- Preventative controls
		- Focuses on preventing the breach from happening
		- Ex: multi-factor authentication
	- Detection and recovery controls
		- Focuses on the security breach
		- Once the breach happens, how quickly can the system be on lockdown?

## Security Controls
- LOOK ON 2 SLIDES
- Contingency Planning
	- Plan during disruption
- Identification and Authentication
- LOOK ON SLIDES
- 8 Slides in total
- They are basically NIST recommendations / steps
- **Probably not going to be any question on this**

## Residual Risk
- # LOOK ON SLIDES

## Cost-Benefit Analysis
- Grade benfit to the organization to save money
- Shows cost justificaiton by reduction in risk
- HAve to show that potential of cost of breach has to be more than fixing it

## IT Security Plan
- Provides details of:
	- What will be done
	- What resources are needed
	- Who is responsible
- Goal is to detail the actions needed to improve the identified deficiencies in the risk profile
- **Should Include**
	- Risks, recommended controls, action priority
	- Selected controls, resources needed
	- Responsible personnel, implementation dates
	- Maintenance requirements

## Implementation Plan
- For each risk:
	- Level of risk
	- Priority
	- Selected Controls
	- Required Resources
	- Etc (look on slides)
## Implentation FOllow-up
- Have to make sure it is working, maintain it, make sure its compliant

## Maintenance
- Periodic review (courterly, monthly, etc)
	- Find certain things that are not working or new
	- So you upgrade the controls to meet the new requirements
	- Every time you have to add new, you have to maek sure everything previously is working
	- Have to address new threats and vulnerabilities aswell

## Security Compliance
- Audit process to review security processes
- Goal is to verify compliance with security plan
- Use internal or external personnel
- Usually based on use of checklists which verify:
	- Suitable policies and plans were created
	- Suitable selection of controls were chosen
	- That they are maintained and used correctly
- Often as part of wider general audit
- Are you tracking the risk? Managing it correct? Is it all there Does the chain of command know / support it?

## Change and Configuration Management
- Change management is the process to review proposed changes to systems
	- Evaluate the impact
	- Important component of general systems administration process
	- Test patches to make sure they dont adversely affect otehr applications
	- May be informal or formal
- Specify which versions of (ex) external libraries are to be downloaded so that they actually work
